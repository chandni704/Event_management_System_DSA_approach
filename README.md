# 🎉 Event Management System – DSA & AIML Approach

A smart, AI-powered platform designed to automate and optimize event planning — from venue discovery to booking confirmation — integrating classical algorithms and modern web technologies.

---

## 🧩 Overview

This project addresses inefficiencies in traditional event booking systems by combining **data structures, Generative AI**, and **secure online payments** in a **MERN Stack** application. It enables **Belagavi residents** to book event venues with ease while providing event managers with tools to manage listings, payments, and system performance.
